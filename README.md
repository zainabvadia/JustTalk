## 💡 Inspiration
Interviews are universal, yet meaningful practice is often a luxury. Our team realized that while many people practice alone, they lack a way to understand **how** they come across. We wanted to build a tool centered on **accessibility and confidence**, turning a high-stress experience into an empowering one by making feedback clear and visual.

## 🚀 What it does
Just Talk is a structured reflective platform for interview prep:
* **Teleprompter Interface:** Read your prepared responses while maintaining "eye contact" with the camera.
* **Simultaneous Recording:** Captures video and audio in real-time.
* **Smart Transcription:** Our backend identifies filler words, pauses, and hesitations.
* **Interactive Review:** A side-by-side view where clicking a transcript segment jumps the video player directly to that moment.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
We chose a "Challenge Stack"—tools we were curious about but hadn't mastered:
* **Frontend:** Next.js with TypeScript
* **Backend:** Spring Boot (Java)
* **AI/Processing:** Gemini API (Speech-to-Text & Analysis)
* **Database:** PostgreSQL (JPA/Hibernate)
* **Infrastructure:** DigitalOcean Spaces & Docker

## 🚧 Challenges We Overcame
Hackathons are about iteration. We faced a steep learning curve:
* **Scrapped Prototypes:** We experimented with (and eventually removed) Auth0 and various transcription pipelines to prioritize a working MVP.
* **Deployment Hurdles:** Debugging backend integrations and DigitalOcean configurations under tight time constraints required constant communication.
* **Adaptability:** We learned to simplify features without losing the core value of the product when we hit technical roadblocks.

## 🏆 Accomplishments & Learnings
* **MVP Success:** Delivered a functional video-to-transcript pipeline in 36 hours.
* **Intentional Learning:** We didn't take shortcuts. We stayed committed to learning our new tech stack even when it was difficult.
* **Team Growth:** We learned how to communicate clearly when stuck and how to support one another through debugging and research.

## 🔮 What's Next?
* **Tone & Pacing Analysis:** Real-time feedback on "Words Per Minute" and vocal pitch.
* **Personalized Coaching:** Integrating RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for expert-level interview recommendations.
* **Longitudinal Tracking:** Progress dashboards to visualize confidence growth over time.
* **Inclusive Design:** Enhanced accessibility including high-contrast modes and adjustable text sizing.
